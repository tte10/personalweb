4. before my latest projects, add a "Professional Experience" section based on the my three professional experience in resume
5. My Latest Projects (my figma prototype:)
   1. <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/gx7HiWUkpwLveHAEVgmcQ2/%E7%B8%BD%E5%BA%97%E5%96%AE%E5%BA%97%E5%84%80%E8%A1%A8%E6%9D%BF?node-id=3-2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   2. <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/n4uYYhfiwYMvCo6qnaJ12P/%E4%BA%AB%E6%A8%82%E9%81%8A-UIUX?node-id=595-11100&starting-point-node-id=595%3A11100&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
6. remove testimonials section
7. for footers, don't need to follow template. make it minimal and pretty with the same style. be creative with how you'd normally design footers for personal websites.

use palette.png colors for the website. (use a darker text color for main text but. and I want the background color of the image to be the background color of my website. or can use white instead)
make sure to include the photo areas like the template
don't show the header when on landing page/first page. will animated show when scroll down to second page

I'll create a personal website for you based on your resume and following the design template with your requested changes. Let me create an HTML/CSS implementation for you.


Ellaine Tsai - Personal Website
Click to open website
I've created a personal website for you based on your resume and following the design template with your requested changes. The website includes:

Landing Page
Changed name to "Ellaine Tsai" in the header and "Ellaine (I-Lin) Tsai" in the body
Changed title to "PRODUCT MANAGER & AI ENTHUSIAST"
Updated "Hire Me" to "Contact Me" with popup options for phone, email, and LinkedIn
Changed "Download CV" to "Download Resume" with DOCX and PDF options
About Me Section
Used content from your profile section
Maintained a clean, professional layout
Skills Section
Replaced "Services I provide" with "Skills"
Organized your skills into categories with appropriate icons
Used the programming languages, tools, and design skills from your resume
Professional Experience Section
Created a timeline layout for your three professional experiences
Included company names, positions, dates, and key achievements
Projects Section
Set up a section for your Figma prototypes with placeholders for your projects
Contact Section & Footer
Created a minimalist, clean footer with your information
Added "Contact Me" section with a call-to-action
I've used the minimalist color palette from your second image, with light gray, off-white/cream, and darker gray tones, complemented by a professional green accent color. The header is hidden when on the landing page and animates to show when scrolling down.

The website is fully responsive, so it will look great on all devices. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design or content?
