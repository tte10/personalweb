create a personal website using information from my resume following template.png for design.
few things to change:
1. First page
   1. change name "Aya Nasser" to "Ellaine Tsai"
      1. use Ellaine Tsai for header, and Ellaine (I-Lin) Tsai for first page body
   2. change "UI/UX Designer" to "PRODUCT MANAGER & AI ENTHUSIAST"
   3. change "Hire Me" to "Contact Me". when clicked, will popup three options
      1. phone number to direct call on one click
      2. my email to send on one click
      3. my linkedin profile with hyperlink
   4. change "download CV" to "Download Resume". when clicked, will popup two options
      1. "DOCX"
      2. "PDF"
2. Second Page
   1. use content from my profile section in About Me here
   2. can skip projects completed, industry covered, years of experience, download cv from template
3. Third Page
   1. Replace "Services I provided" to "Skills". use skills from my resume and add emoji respectively to each category
4. before my latest projects, add a "Professional Experience" section based on the my three professional experience in resume
5. My Latest Projects (my figma prototype:)
   1. <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/gx7HiWUkpwLveHAEVgmcQ2/%E7%B8%BD%E5%BA%97%E5%96%AE%E5%BA%97%E5%84%80%E8%A1%A8%E6%9D%BF?node-id=3-2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   2. <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/n4uYYhfiwYMvCo6qnaJ12P/%E4%BA%AB%E6%A8%82%E9%81%8A-UIUX?node-id=595-11100&starting-point-node-id=595%3A11100&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
6. remove testimonials section
7. for footers, don't need to follow template. make it minimal and pretty with the same style. be creative with how you'd normally design footers for personal websites.

* use palette.png colors for the website. (use a darker text color for main text but. and I want the background color of the image to be the background color of my website. or can use white instead)
* make sure to include the photo areas like the template
* don't show the header when on landing page/first page. will animated show when scroll down to second page
